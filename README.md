# What is this?

What you see is a repository of Concurrent Programming course (further referred to as "CP") dedicated to the second year CS students offered by the facultaty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics of the University of Warsaw (further referred to as "MIM UW").

# What does this repository have?

This repository has: 

- [all_laboratories](https://github.com/MrRuper/Concurrent_programming/tree/master/all_laboratories) folder contains all examples given in computer classes. Each subfolder of **all_laboratories** will have **README.md** file where you can find whole description of presented problems / examples and their main goals. 
- [smaller_homework_projects](https://github.com/MrRuper/Concurrent_programming/tree/master/smaller_homework_projects) folder mostly contains solutions to the "one-day problems" i.e. smaller projects which I recently got on laboratory meetings. Each of such solutions has README.md where whole problem description with explanation could be found. Most of the problems presented here are, to put it mildly, easy and short. The goal of such problems is to show how to use **JAVA**, **C** and **C++** to solve "standard" CP problems.
- [bigger_homework_projects](https://github.com/MrRuper/Concurrent_programming/tree/master/bigger_homework_projects) folder contains three large projects given during the course. The first one is **JAVA** project, the second one is **C** project and the third one is **C++** project. Every project has its own README.md file where as always you can find the problem description with explanation of the solution.
